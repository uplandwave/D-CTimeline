## Overview
The Revelation Timeline is a simple, interactive web app designed to visually represent key events in early Church history. The project was created as part of an LDS Institute class focused on the first half of the Doctrine and Covenants.

## Features
- **Interactive Timeline** – A clean and minimal timeline representing significant events.
- **Event Details** – Each stop displays more context about the event, including related Doctrine and Covenants sections.
- **Historical Insights** – Learn important revelations received by Joseph Smith and key moments in Church history.
- **Lightweight & Fast** – Built with Svelte and hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.

## How It Works
1. The timeline is positioned at the bottom of the screen with event markers.
2. Hovering over a marker reveals the date of the event.
3. Clicking a marker brings up more details, including relevant D&C sections and an image.

- **PNPM** - Used instead of NPM because I like it.
